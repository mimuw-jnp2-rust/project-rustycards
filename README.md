## Description
Rusty Cards is going to be a duel, card game with online gameplay.

## Features
- Lobby that enables connection beetween two players with GUI
- A duel with GUI:
  - Drawing cards
  - Gaining mana
  - Droping cards into the battlefield
  - Attacking with the cards on your battlefield

## Later Features
- Card collection
- Customizable decks

## Plan
In the first part we're going to implement the logic that stays behind the game. It will be possible  play the game with one deck, using command line (without GUI).

In the second part we're going to create a lobby and add GUI.

Later we will try to develop the project - we will add more cards, card collection and we will enable deck custommization.

## Libraries
- Serde (for serialization)
- Need to choose one for the graphics
- Need to choose one for game engine
